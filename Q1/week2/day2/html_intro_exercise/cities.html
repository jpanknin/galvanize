    <h2>Cities I Have Lived In</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Corpus Christi, TX</li>
      <li>Kerrville, TX</li>
      <li>San Antonio, TX</li>

    <p>I was born in Corpus Christi, went to college in both Kerrville, TX
    and San Antoio, TX before joining the military and getting stationed in
    San Diego, CA.  I then worked in Biloxi, MS after Hurricane Katrina
    before being deployed to Djibouti, Africa in 2010.  Upon returning
    from Africa, I moved to Brooklyn, NY and started grade school at NYU.
    Finally, I made the move to Manhattan and became (somewhat) a New
    Yorker.</p>

      <li>Tehran, Iran</li>
      <li>Paris, France</li>
      <li>Bogota, Colombia</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I've heard Iran is a beautiful place despite the political environment
    and Paris is full of history.  I've also heard great things about Colombia.</p>
